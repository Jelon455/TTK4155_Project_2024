# TTK4155_Project_2024
Project for NTNU's course TTK4155.
This term project aims at creating a **computer controlled electromechanical ping pong game**. The
electronic components, game boards and development tools needed to realize the game will be
handed out in the beginning of the semester. The main challenge will be to assemble the hardware
components and develop software for the microcontrollers, making a fully functional embedded
computer system that will enable you to play a refreshing game of ping pong. The term project
is in essence a rather comprehensive laboratory exercise which requires allocation of a substantial
amount of time for lab work throughout the semester. To make the project easier to complete, it
is divided into a number of smaller weekly exercises which will ensure continuity in the work and
necessary progress in the project.
